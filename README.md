# Text Summarization with Pegasus Model on SAMSum Dataset
# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail model for summarizing dialogues from the SAMSum dataset. The SAMSum dataset consists of conversations in natural language, and the task is to generate concise summaries that capture the main points of these conversations.
The google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail model, pre-trained for text summarization tasks, is fine-tuned to extract the key points from these dialogues, resulting in meaningful and compact summaries.

# Objectives
Fine-tune a pre-trained model for the task of summarizing dialogues from the SAMSum dataset.
Use the google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail model to generate summaries for dialogue-based data.
Evaluate the performance of the summarization model on the SAMSum dataset.
# SAMSum Dataset
The SAMSum dataset is a collection of conversations that includes both the dialogue text and human-written summaries. It is widely used for training and evaluating dialogue summarization models.
Dialogue: A conversation between two or more participants.
Summary: A concise description of the conversation, highlighting its key points.
The dataset consists of 16,000 dialogues split into training, validation, and test sets.

# Model Details
The model used in this project is google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail, which was pre-trained on news articles and has shown state-of-the-art performance in text summarization tasks. It uses the PEGASUS architecture, which is specifically designed for abstractive summarization.

# Steps for Model Training and Summarization
# Data Preprocessing:
The SAMSum dataset is processed to align the dialogue data with the format required by the model.
Tokenization and formatting are done to ensure that the input text is compatible with the PEGASUS model.
# Model Fine-Tuning:
The pre-trained google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail model is fine-tuned on the SAMSum dataset. The model learns to generate relevant summaries based on dialogue input.
# Evaluation:
After fine-tuning, the model is evaluated on the validation and test sets.
Metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) are used to evaluate the quality of the generated summaries.
# Key Features
Pre-trained Model: Uses the google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail model, which is pre-trained on a large corpus of text for summarization tasks.
Abstractive Summarization: The model generates summaries that are not just extracted from the input text, but are rephrased and condensed in a meaningful way.
Fine-Tuning: The model is fine-tuned on the SAMSum dataset to ensure it captures the nuances of conversational data.
# Results
The model's performance is measured using the ROUGE score, which evaluates how well the generated summaries overlap with reference summaries. Higher ROUGE scores indicate better performance in terms of content coverage and fluency.
